# Brushable Histogram

## 1.2.0 (2019/04/9)
- Allow the user to define a custom `brushDomain` via `props`.
- Update Storybook to 5.x
- The scales are updared if `yAccessor` or `xAccessor` are changed
- Update eslint config

## 1.1.10 (2019/03/29)

- Fix Histogram's `onIntervalChange` method not being called when the graph's histogram data changes (and the graph itself) but the domain min and max remains the same. This change will cause a little degradation in the brushing performance, since the `setState` method will be invoke many times, even when there was no changes in the brush range. We will try to address this side effect in the next version.

## 1.1.9 (2019/03/20)

- Fix a bug related with data replacement on update ([#36](https://github.com/feedzai/brushable-histogram/pull/36#issue-262504945))

## 1.1.8 (2019/03/15)

- Fix a bug related with screen resizing events

## 1.1.7 (2019/02/19)

  and brushing areas ([#26](https://github.com/feedzai/brushable-histogram/issues/26))
- Fix bug related with brush size resizing ([#30](https://github.com/feedzai/brushable-histogram/issues/30))
- Exports a css file
- Ignoring directories that are irrelevant for this component releases.
  Like unit tests, documentation and storybook files.

  tests.
